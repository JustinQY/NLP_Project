You are going to generate a new episode of the show *Friends*.

The episode should include multiple scenes, natural conversations, character-specific humor, and a clear ending.

[Scene: Restaurant, Monica, Rachel are having dinner.]
------------------------------------------------------


Monica: It was one time! And it was structurally sound!
Rachel: Well, he does have a point.
Chandler: You mean the part where he compared your lasagna to insulation?
Rachel: Okay, I'm sorry about all that, but you guys gotta understand something...
Monica: No we don't get anything, because this is not our wedding!!
[Pause]   Chandler: So there's some stuff in this guy's life you probably didn't know about right??
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joey: Yeah man I was kinda scared when I found out about his sex obsession with anatomical illustration books from the turn of the century.

Monica: Yes it took me almost six months to build my nest upstairs which had no heat or running water just so that Mike could come home and make bird sounds at night while masturbating. But whatever works for him..I guess. We were gonna live together anyway! Right now its like hell on earth living here without him. He knows how much better its gonna be once hes gone!!

Ross: (to Joey) Thats really interesting dude, wow can u explain to us what was going through your head during the first time when he went crazy in front of everybody after you told them they were still engaged....It sure as shit made ya think twice before giving advice ever again huh!
   (They sit back down, then start laughing.)
   (pause)
Monica: (Sitting next to Ross) Isnt this great!!! We dont even need Chandler anymore do we?(To Phoebe, who doesnt look happy about their conversation). Look at her over there totally pissed off by everything we said. Im surprised she didnt stab somebody today.
Ross: Wait no, did you say stabbing?
{cut to later}
Mike: Alright guys thats enough! Can someone tell these people to put down those weapons before somebody gets killed!
Gun Girl: What weapons sir? Weapons are words. And we use many words today. Many words. Words about your fiancees past, about yours. About this city youre leaving soon. About why you havent taken care of yourself lately. Those are all words that hurt. They may seem harmless on paper, because Im writing this letter to you, and not anyone else. This letter will never be read aloud! So no one cares if they hurt. Except for you, because you asked for us to talk. All Im saying is maybe your fianc√©e has been talking to other birds too yknow. Maybe theres another nest waiting somewhere nearby for you too yknow.
Ross looks very depressed as gun girl leaves, followed closely behind by everyone around the table except Monica and Phoebe, whom walk away chatting happily. Ross walks into Joey who gives him a high five.}
   (Later cut to the party scene, Gun girls bandage is missing)
Joey: Oh my god! Honey, look! She got shot! Shot by a woman that likes her boyfriend more than she loves herself!!!! Somebody call paramedics quick!! Shock! (Starting singing) Pullin em apart ohhhh oooohhh yeah...oopsies, i forgot to set mic on tape mode. Hey Mon, want to sing the second verse with me? (She starts singing uncomfortably, although somewhat well) Ow ow ow, owwwwwOohhhhoooOh ho hoHUHH! (finishes)
   (later, Rosss looking sadly at monicas newly empty house)
Joey: Dude, cant believe its already over. Now things arent perfect, okay, but Im getting used to being around two women and I actually feel pretty good. Plus we got ourselves one of the best couples ever! And one of the worst couches in history! Goodbye. (Storms outside) Oh man, and also my favorite place in the world to play guitar, goodbye forever. That was funny though, playing guitar naked. God I love that so much. Damn, and I thought I left myself a lot of closure today.(He heads towards the door only to find it locked.) Ah damnit, locksmith!
{Time lapse/Scene change, Everyone sitting around a candlelit dinner table drinking wine and smiling. The camera shows each persons face in turn starting with Joeys, then moves onto Monica, who seems sadder than the rest; turns to Rachels happy face with a tear rolling down, then to the others grimaces and finally ends with Chadlers joyless expression.)
Rachel Green: Remember when we graduated college and moved to New York City? (Takes a sip of alcoholic beverage.) Or anytime since then. Whenever you wanted to hear stories about your childhood youd ask your mom, cause you knew shell never forget all the details. Meantime youll remember the summer vacations we spent in Vermont, but nothing about the summer before sixth grade. In a year, none of this will matter to you, so enjoy the fact that you care what happened in ninth grade English.
All: True story. (Aside) Man! Did that suck. Just watch it kids, and try to stay positive. Cutting loose is cool, cutting off ones nose is not. Okay.
The Tanners: Thanks for joining us tonight. It means so much to us. Enjoy the rest of your evening. Bye-bye friends!
   (Everyone stands up and leaves leaving Joey alone standing by the table holding his handgun.)
