You wanna say hi?\\nMonica: No, no, I don't.\\nRachel: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?\\nRoss: My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.\\nPhoebe: That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?\\nChandler: Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!\\nMonica: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?\\nRoss: Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...\\nMonica: Why don't you just get a roommate?\\nRoss: Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.\\nOpening Credits\\n[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is getting ready to sing. Joey is not there.]\\nPhoebe: So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.\\nChandler: Might wanna open with the snowman.\\n(Enter Joey)\\nAll: Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.\\nMonica: So, how'd it go?\\nJoey: Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.\\nRoss: How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.\\nJoey: I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.\\nMonica: So what are you gonna be?\\nJoey: Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?\\nRachel: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?\\nChandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!\\nRachel: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. \\nPhoebe: Yeah, you wish!\\nChandler: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.\\nAll: Yeah, okay. Alright.\\nChandler: Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. \\nAll: Woooo! Yeah!\\nRachel: Phoebe, you're on.\\nPhoebe: Oh, oh, good.\\nRachel: (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!\\nPhoebe: (Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung:) \\nI made a man with eyes of coal   And a smile so bewitchin',   How was I supposed to know   That my mom was dead in the kitchen?   (shakes bell) La lalala la la la la lalala la la...\\n(Cut to later. Everyone is totally depressed by now.)\\nPhoebe: (Sung) \\n...My mother's ashes   Even her eyelashes   Are resting in a little yellow jar,   And sometimes when it's breezy...\\n(Over the sound of Phoebe singing we hear two scientists, Max and David, having a noisy discussion)\\nPhoebe: (Sung) \\n...I feel a little sneezy   And now I- (abruptly stops) \\nExcuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! (They stop talking and look up) Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?\\nMax: No. No, that's- that's okay.\\nPhoebe: Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!\\nChandler: (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!\\nDavid: Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-\\nPhoebe: Could you speak up please?\\nDavid: (Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought\\nMax: Daryl Hannah.\\nDavid: Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a \\nMax: Hard quality.\\nDavid: -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. (Sits down)\\nPhoebe: Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)\\nJoey: Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!\\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey is decorating for Christmas.]\\nRoss: Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)\\nRachel: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?\\nRoss: Just a smidge.\\nPhoebe: David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.\\nMonica: I think it's romantic.\\nPhoebe: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?\\nRachel: Yeah!\\nPhoebe: Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... \\nChandler: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.\\nPhoebe: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?\\nChandler: Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.\\nMonica: What?!\\nRoss: C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! \\nChandler: I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.\\nMonica: Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!\\nChandler: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!\\n[Joey enters, his shoes have bells on, which jingle as he walks. He is wearing a long coat.]\\nJoey: Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.\\n(He removes the coat to reveal an elf costume)\\nChandler: Too many jokes... must mock Joey! \\nJoey: Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)\\nChandler: Aah, y'killing me!\\n(Marcel knocks over some kitchen tools)\\nMonica: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!\\nRoss: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?\\nMonica: Do you always have to bring him here?\\nRoss: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...\\nChandler: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.\\nRoss: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.\\nChandler: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.\\n[Scene: Max and David's lab, David is explaining something to Phoebe with the aid of a whiteboard.]\\nDavid: ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.\\nPhoebe: Okay, alright, I have a question, then. \\nDavid: Yuh.\\nPhoebe: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?\\nDavid: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be (Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.\\nPhoebe: Sure.\\nDavid: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.\\nPhoebe: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.\\nDavid: Rrrreally.\\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me. \\nDavid: ...Now? Now?\\nPhoebe: Oh yeah, right now.\\nDavid: Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop computer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks up a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)\\nPhoebe: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. \\nDavid: Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?\\nPhoebe: I can hop. (She hops onto the table)\\n(They kiss, finally)\\n[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]\\nRoss: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?\\nMonica: I'm sorry, okay.

He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands... \\nChandler: That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.\\nRoss: Really.\\nChandler: Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.\\nRoss: What, uh... what juggling thing?\\nChandler: With the balled-up socks?

Ross enters with Marcel on his shoulder)\\nRoss: Par-tay! \\nMonica: That thing is not coming in here.\\nRoss: 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?\\nMonica: I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.\\nRoss: Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...\\nMonica: Alright. Just keep him away from me.\\nRoss: Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.\\n(The door opens. Rachel is standing there. Her coat is muddy and torn, her hair is dishevelled and her face is bruised. Everyone turns to look)\\nMonica: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?\\nRachel: Rome. Jerk missed his flight.\\nPhoebe: And then... your face is bloated?\\nRachel: No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?\\n[Time lapse. Monica and Rachel, fixed up somewhat, emerge from a bedroom]\\nSandy: Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.\\nJoey: Wow, that's, uh, dirty.\\nSandy: Yeah.\\n(They almost kiss and then Joey realises her kids are staring at them)\\nJoey: Hey, kids...\\nRoss: (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.\\nJanice: (Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!\\nChandler: (Imitating) But you found me!\\nJanice: Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!\\nChandler: Kill me. Kill me now. \\n(Someone else knocks on the door. Monica looks through the spyhole)\\nMonica: Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!\\n(Everyone cheers. Monica opens the door. Bobby is obviously very depressed)\\nFun Bobby: Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!\\nJoey: (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?\\n(Monica gestures wildly behind Fun Bobby's back) \\n[Time lapse. Bobby is talking about his grandfather. Everyone else is virtually in tears]\\nFun Bobby: It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.\\nJanice: (Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.\\nChandler: Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-\\nJanice: Oh, no. Oh, no.\\nChandler: I'm sorry you misunderstood...\\nJanice: Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)\\n(Ross is still taking photos)\\nChandler: Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)\\n(David is feeding Phoebe popcorn. Max walks up)\\nPhoebe: Hi, Max!\\nMax: Yoko. (To David) I've decided to go to Minsk without you.\\nDavid: Wow.\\nMax: It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)\\nPhoebe: Are you alright?\\nDavid: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. \\n(Phoebe leads David into a bedroom)\\nPhoebe: You're going to Minsk.\\nDavid: No, I'm... not going to Minsk.\\nPhoebe: Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.\\nDavid: Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.\\nPhoebe: Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.\\nDavid: Uh, ow.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.\\nDavid: I'll never forget you.\\nPhoebe: And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.\\nDick Clark: (on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...\\n(Joey puts a blanket over Sandy's kids)\\nJoey: There y'go, kids.\\nChandler: (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)\\nJoey: You seen Sandy?\\nChandler: Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.\\nRachel: Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.\\nAll: (in the kitchen) What?\\nRachel: The bll is drrbing!\\nDick Clark: (on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...\\nChandler: And the moment of joy is upon us.\\nJoey: Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.\\nPhoebe: Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.\\nMonica: Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!\\n(Bobby waves and then bursts into tears. Midnight comes and everyone at the party except for the gang cheers and kisses)\\nChandler: Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)\\nPhoebe: I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.\\nRachel: I can't kiss anyone.\\nMonica: So I'm kissing everyone?\\nJoey: Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.\\nRoss: Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.\\nChandler: Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!\\nJoey: Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.\\nClosing Credits\\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time lapse.]\\nRoss: (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.\\nRachel: ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.\\nEnd\",\n          \"THE ONE WITH JOEYS DIRTY DAY\\nWritten by: Wil Calhoun Transcribed by: Eric Aasen\\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is getting ready for a fishing trip and Phoebe is asking him about the fishing lures.

[The patented version.]\\nChandler: What Richard thing?\\nPhoebe: (To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!\\nMonica: Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.\\nChandler: (talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.\\nMonica: Really?!\\nChandler: Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.

As she bends over to grab a bottle of wine, her robe falls open (Damn this network primetime programming, we didn't see anything!) and she quickly closes it again. But then realizes she didn't have to do that. So she closes the fridge and stands next to the table, thinks about it for a little while and]\\nRachel: (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In her head.) Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchennaked! I'm picking up an orange. (Does so) I'm naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body away.)\\n[Cut to Ross's apartment, he's sitting by his window looking at an art book. As he's turning the page, he glances up and notices something.]\\nRoss: (in his head) Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. (Looks back at his book.) Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokesUnless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?\\n[Cut back to Monica and Rachel's apartment, Rachel is singing along with a song and dancing while facing the big picture window. Y'know, I think I'd pay real good money to be on the other side of that window!]\\nRachel: (singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! (There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to answer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh.

(Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.) This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of \\\"Us.\\\" (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)\\nRachel: And um, what-what is that Ross?\\nRoss: The physical act of love. (Hisses at her.)\\nRachel: (laughs) What?! Are you crazy?\\nRoss: Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?\\nRachel: (gasps) Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!\\nRoss: You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.\\nRachel: Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!\\nRoss: No! No! (Grabs his coat) No!

Im sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!\\nRoss: Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?\\nRachel: Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.\\nRoss: Thank you.\\nRachel: Yes.\\nRoss: All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)\\nRachel: Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of \\\"us?\\\"\\n(Ross storms off embarrassed.)\\n[Scene: Las Vegas, we have the typical glamour shots of Vegas, the Strip, slot machines, a couple other gaming tables all set to the tune of you guessed it, Money. Anyhoo, we finally get through that and watch Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe enter Caesar's Palace carrying their luggage.]\\nPhoebe: Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner.

I thought I told you not to come.\\nPhoebe: Why are you dressed as a gladiator?\\nJoey: Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.\\nMonica: Who are you talking too?\\nJoey: They uh director. Uhh, her.

What happened?!\\nJoey: Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.\\nMonica: I'm so sorry.\\nJoey: Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man.\\nChandler: No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.\\nMonica: I knew you were not okay with that.\\nPhoebe: So you're a gladiator! Wow!\\nJoey: Yeah, what-what's going on?\\nPhoebe: Monica had lunch with Richard.\\nJoey: Dawson?! \\nPhoebe: Noo! But that would've been so cool!\\nChandler: No!

(Walks away.)\\n[Scene: An aircraft cabin, Ross and Rachel are on their way to Vegas.]\\nRachel: (taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.\\nRoss: (sarcastic) Yep! That's hilarious!\\nRachel: I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.\\nRoss: Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.\\nRachel: No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.\\nRoss: Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.\\nRachel: Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.\\nRoss: What?! You totally get embarrassed!\\nRachel: No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.\\nRoss: Is that so?\\nRachel: Yeah.\\n(Pause.)\\nRoss: (loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachel sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)\\n[Scene: Chandler's hotel room, he's sitting there with Joey who's talking about his helmet and running his hand through that feathery thing at the top.]\\nJoey: Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.\\nChandler: Really?\\nJoey: Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right\\nChandler: (interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.\\nJoey: All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.\\nChandler: Whoa!\\nJoey: Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!\\nChandler: Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)\\nJoey: Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!\\nChandler: Good luck! \\nJoey: Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!\\nChandler: I see.\\n(Joey exits as Chandler shakes his head.)\\nCommercial Break\\n[Scene: The casino bar, Phoebe and Monica are sitting at the bar, while Wayne Newton's signature song Danke Schoen is playing in the background.]\\nMonica: (to the bartender) Thank you.\\nPhoebe: Thanks.\\nMonica: I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!\\nPhoebe: Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so sorry.\\nMonica: This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.\\nPhoebe: So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.\\nMonica: Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to find Chandler.)\\nPhoebe: Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!\\n[Cut to the casino, Monica is walking through it past the craps table when she notices a chip on the floor. She picks it up and heads to the table.]\\nMonica: Anybody lose this? (Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes her head no.)\\nThe Croupier: Comin' out. Place your bet. (Monica does so.) Dice are out. (The woman next to Monica rolls the dice.) Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! (Monica won and doubled the chip.)\\nMonica: Hmm.\\n[Scene: An airplane cabin, Ross and Rachel are both reading as a guy stops by their row.]\\nGuy: (To Rachel) So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom. (Ross giggles.)\\nRachel: Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?\\n(Ross keeps giggling and Rachel decides upon revenge. She gets up and kisses the rather large man in the seat in front of Ross on the back of his head. The guy turns around angrily.)\\nRachel: Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.\\n[Time lapse, Ross is drinking something and decides to get Rachel again.]\\nRoss: (to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)\\n[Time lapse, Rachel pushes the flight attendant call button, takes Ross's drink, and spills it into his lap.]\\nRoss: What the? What\\nRachel: (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn't real, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pants would be dry.) Hi! \\nThe Flight Attendant: Miss? May I help you?\\nRachel: Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.\\n[Scene: Caesar's Palace Casino, Joey is approaching one of the blackjack tables on his quest to make enough money for his movie.]\\nJoey: (to the dealer) Can I change a hundred?

(After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checks herself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!\\n[Scene: Caesar's Palace Casino, Chandler is looking for Monica while Tom Jones's signature song is playing in the background (Getting the theme yet? Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, casinos They're in Vegas people! Catch up!) It's Not Unusual, y'know, \\\"It's not unusual to be loved by anyone! It's not unusual to have fun with anyone!  But when I see you hanging about with anyone, it's not unusual to see me cry!  I wanna die.\\\" Well, while that's playing he spots Monica playing craps and in victory hug the guy next to her. Chandler turns and walks out.]\\n[Scene: That same plane cabin, Ross is working on a crossword puzzle and Rachel is asleep against his shoulder. She shifts a little bit and Ross suddenly gets an idea. An evil idea when he looks at his pen. Then we have a little time lapse, the plane has landed and everyone is disembarking. The flight attendant is saying bye-bye to everyone.]\\nThe Flight Attendant: (to another passenger) Welcome to Las Vegas.\\n(Rachel approaches and we see the fruits of Ross's evil plan.

No-no, a lurker.\\nPhoebe: Oh. What's a lurker?\\nRoss: Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then\\nPhoebe: Kills you?\\nRoss: No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.\\nPhoebe: Ohhh!\\nRoss: Uh-hmm.\\nPhoebe: How do you know about this?\\nRoss: My nana used to do it.

(Heads for the bathroom.)\\n[Scene: Ross and Rachel's hotel room, Rachel is still trying to get the ink off and Ross is on the phone to the company. Wait a minute, why exactly are they sharing a hotel room? Didn't they like break-up or something? Did I miss a memo? Or maybe, it's just foreshadowing things to come. Who knows? Maybe the answer's at the bottom of the page. Then again, maybe it isn't and it's just one of those things TV writers just don't explain. Anyhoo]\\nRoss: (on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you. (Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, she didn't think so.

There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!\\nRoss: Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.\\nRachel: Ross, I am a human doodle!!\\nRoss: Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around and glares at him.) There are tonsoffreaks here. No other. No. Come on!

(Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)\\nRoss: Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel glares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is, one big drink! \\nRachel: (she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.) Macadamia nut?\\nRoss: (looking at the price list) Umm Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!\\nRachel: Hm-mmm! (Opens the container)\\nRoss: Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?\\nRachel: Nope!

(She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker scurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her in the act.) That's it! You and me, outside!\\nThe Lurker: I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!\\n(They start smacking each other's cups, but Phoebe notices a security guard approaching.)\\nPhoebe: Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady, your lurking days are over!\\nThe Lurker: What?!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first!
