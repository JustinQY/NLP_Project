It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?\\nRachel: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?\\nChandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!\\nRachel: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. \\nPhoebe: Yeah, you wish!\\nChandler: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.\\nAll: Yeah, okay. Alright.\\nChandler: Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. \\nAll: Woooo!

And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. (Sits down)\\nPhoebe: Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)\\nJoey: Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!\\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey is decorating for Christmas.]\\nRoss: Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)\\nRachel: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?\\nRoss: Just a smidge.\\nPhoebe: David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.\\nMonica: I think it's romantic.\\nPhoebe: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?\\nRachel: Yeah!\\nPhoebe: Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... \\nChandler: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.\\nPhoebe: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?\\nChandler: Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.\\nMonica: What?!\\nRoss: C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! \\nChandler: I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.\\nMonica: Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!\\nChandler: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!\\n[Joey enters, his shoes have bells on, which jingle as he walks. He is wearing a long coat.]\\nJoey: Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.\\n(He removes the coat to reveal an elf costume)\\nChandler: Too many jokes... must mock Joey! \\nJoey: Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)\\nChandler: Aah, y'killing me!\\n(Marcel knocks over some kitchen tools)\\nMonica: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!\\nRoss: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?\\nMonica: Do you always have to bring him here?\\nRoss: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...\\nChandler: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.\\nRoss: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.\\nChandler: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.\\n[Scene: Max and David's lab, David is explaining something to Phoebe with the aid of a whiteboard.]\\nDavid: ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.\\nPhoebe: Okay, alright, I have a question, then. \\nDavid: Yuh.\\nPhoebe: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?\\nDavid: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be (Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.\\nPhoebe: Sure.\\nDavid: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.\\nPhoebe: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.\\nDavid: Rrrreally.\\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me. \\nDavid: ...Now? Now?\\nPhoebe: Oh yeah, right now.\\nDavid: Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop computer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks up a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)\\nPhoebe: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. \\nDavid: Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?\\nPhoebe: I can hop. (She hops onto the table)\\n(They kiss, finally)\\n[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]\\nRoss: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?\\nMonica: I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.\\nChandler: Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?\\nMonica: Yeah.\\nJoey: You know more than one Fun Bobby?\\nChandler: I happen to know a Fun Bob.\\nRachel: (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...\\nJoey: Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!\\nRachel: (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.\\nRoss: Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.\\nJoey: Uh, four.\\nRoss: Four.\\nRachel: Five.\\nRoss: Five. (Buries his head in his hands)\\nRachel: Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.\\nJoey: Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?\\nRoss: Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?\\nRachel: Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.\\nRoss: Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.\\nMonica: What's the matter?\\nRoss: Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands... \\nChandler: That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.\\nRoss: Really.\\nChandler: Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.\\nRoss: What, uh... what juggling thing?\\nChandler: With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.\\nRoss: No.\\nChandler: Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...\\n(Max runs in)\\nMax: Phoebe. Hi. \\nPhoebe: Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?\\nMax: No. Have you seen David?\\nPhoebe: No, no, he hasn't been around.\\nMax: Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.\\nPhoebe: Minsk?\\nMax: Minsk. It's in Russia.\\nPhoebe: I know where Minsk is.\\nMax: We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.\\nPhoebe: So when, when do you leave?\\nMax: January first.\\nCommercial Break\\n[Scene: Max and David's lab, they are working. Phoebe knocks on the door]\\nPhoebe: Hello?\\nDavid: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hi.\\nDavid: Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?\\nPhoebe: Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice) congratulations! This is so exciting!\\nMax: It'd be even more exciting if we were going.\\nPhoebe: Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?\\nMax: Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' (Storms out)\\nDavid: Thank you, Max. Thank you.\\nPhoebe: So-so you're really not going?\\nDavid: I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.\\nPhoebe: Oh don't do that.\\nDavid: Please.\\nPhoebe: Oh no no.\\nDavid: No, but I'm asking-\\nPhoebe: Oh, but I can't do that-\\nDavid: No, but I can't-\\nPhoebe: It's your thing, and-\\nDavid: -make the decision-\\nPhoebe: Okay, um, stay.\\nDavid: Stay.\\nPhoebe: Stay.\\n(He thinks for a moment and sweeps the stuff off the table)\\nPhoebe: Getting so good at that! (She hops on)\\nDavid: It was Max's stuff. (They kiss)\\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the party has started.]\\nJanice: I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)\\nChandler: You remember Janice.\\nMonica: Vividly.\\n(Someone knocks on the door; Monica gets it)\\nMonica: Hi.\\nSandy: Hi, I'm Sandy.\\nJoey: Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...You brought your kids.\\nSandy: Yeah. That's okay, right?\\n(Joey and Monica look at each other and shrug. Ross enters with Marcel on his shoulder)\\nRoss: Par-tay! \\nMonica: That thing is not coming in here.\\nRoss: 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?\\nMonica: I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.\\nRoss: Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...\\nMonica: Alright. Just keep him away from me.\\nRoss: Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.\\n(The door opens. Rachel is standing there. Her coat is muddy and torn, her hair is dishevelled and her face is bruised. Everyone turns to look)\\nMonica: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?\\nRachel: Rome. Jerk missed his flight.\\nPhoebe: And then... your face is bloated?\\nRachel: No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?\\n[Time lapse. Monica and Rachel, fixed up somewhat, emerge from a bedroom]\\nSandy: Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.\\nJoey: Wow, that's, uh, dirty.\\nSandy: Yeah.\\n(They almost kiss and then Joey realises her kids are staring at them)\\nJoey: Hey, kids...\\nRoss: (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.\\nJanice: (Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!\\nChandler: (Imitating) But you found me!\\nJanice: Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!\\nChandler: Kill me. Kill me now. \\n(Someone else knocks on the door. Monica looks through the spyhole)\\nMonica: Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!\\n(Everyone cheers. Monica opens the door. Bobby is obviously very depressed)\\nFun Bobby: Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!\\nJoey: (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?\\n(Monica gestures wildly behind Fun Bobby's back) \\n[Time lapse. Bobby is talking about his grandfather. Everyone else is virtually in tears]\\nFun Bobby: It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.\\nJanice: (Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.\\nChandler: Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-\\nJanice: Oh, no. Oh, no.\\nChandler: I'm sorry you misunderstood...\\nJanice: Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)\\n(Ross is still taking photos)\\nChandler: Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)\\n(David is feeding Phoebe popcorn. Max walks up)\\nPhoebe: Hi, Max!\\nMax: Yoko. (To David) I've decided to go to Minsk without you.\\nDavid: Wow.\\nMax: It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)\\nPhoebe: Are you alright?\\nDavid: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. \\n(Phoebe leads David into a bedroom)\\nPhoebe: You're going to Minsk.\\nDavid: No, I'm... not going to Minsk.\\nPhoebe: Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.\\nDavid: Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.\\nPhoebe: Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.\\nDavid: Uh, ow.\\nPhoebe: Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.\\nDavid: I'll never forget you.\\nPhoebe: And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.\\nDick Clark: (on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...\\n(Joey puts a blanket over Sandy's kids)\\nJoey: There y'go, kids.\\nChandler: (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)\\nJoey: You seen Sandy?\\nChandler: Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.\\nRachel: Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.\\nAll: (in the kitchen) What?\\nRachel: The bll is drrbing!\\nDick Clark: (on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...\\nChandler: And the moment of joy is upon us.\\nJoey: Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.\\nPhoebe: Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.\\nMonica: Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!\\n(Bobby waves and then bursts into tears. Midnight comes and everyone at the party except for the gang cheers and kisses)\\nChandler: Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)\\nPhoebe: I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.\\nRachel: I can't kiss anyone.\\nMonica: So I'm kissing everyone?\\nJoey: Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.\\nRoss: Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.\\nChandler: Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!\\nJoey: Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.\\nClosing Credits\\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time lapse.]\\nRoss: (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.\\nRachel: ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.\\nEnd\",\n          \"THE ONE WITH JOEYS DIRTY DAY\\nWritten by: Wil Calhoun Transcribed by: Eric Aasen\\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is getting ready for a fishing trip and Phoebe is asking him about the fishing lures.

How did it go with Joshua last night?\\nRachel: Well, I didnt see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.\\nMonica: What?\\nPhoebe: Why?\\nRachel: The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.\\nPhoebe: Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?\\nRachel: No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, \\\"Im Rachel Greep! Im Rachel Greep!\\\" and he let her right in. \\nMonica: So you hit her in the face?\\nRachel: No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her.

Go with Simmons!\\nMonica: Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did.

As she bends over to grab a bottle of wine, her robe falls open (Damn this network primetime programming, we didn't see anything!) and she quickly closes it again. But then realizes she didn't have to do that. So she closes the fridge and stands next to the table, thinks about it for a little while and]\\nRachel: (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up.

Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokesUnless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing?

I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachel sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)\\n[Scene: Chandler's hotel room, he's sitting there with Joey who's talking about his helmet and running his hand through that feathery thing at the top.]\\nJoey: Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.\\nChandler: Really?\\nJoey: Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right\\nChandler: (interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.\\nJoey: All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.\\nChandler: Whoa!\\nJoey: Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!\\nChandler: Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)\\nJoey: Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!\\nChandler: Good luck! \\nJoey: Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!\\nChandler: I see.\\n(Joey exits as Chandler shakes his head.)\\nCommercial Break\\n[Scene: The casino bar, Phoebe and Monica are sitting at the bar, while Wayne Newton's signature song Danke Schoen is playing in the background.]\\nMonica: (to the bartender) Thank you.\\nPhoebe: Thanks.\\nMonica: I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!\\nPhoebe: Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so sorry.\\nMonica: This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.\\nPhoebe: So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.\\nMonica: Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to find Chandler.)\\nPhoebe: Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!\\n[Cut to the casino, Monica is walking through it past the craps table when she notices a chip on the floor. She picks it up and heads to the table.]\\nMonica: Anybody lose this? (Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes her head no.)\\nThe Croupier: Comin' out. Place your bet. (Monica does so.) Dice are out. (The woman next to Monica rolls the dice.) Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! (Monica won and doubled the chip.)\\nMonica: Hmm.\\n[Scene: An airplane cabin, Ross and Rachel are both reading as a guy stops by their row.]\\nGuy: (To Rachel) So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom. (Ross giggles.)\\nRachel: Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?\\n(Ross keeps giggling and Rachel decides upon revenge. She gets up and kisses the rather large man in the seat in front of Ross on the back of his head. The guy turns around angrily.)\\nRachel: Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.\\n[Time lapse, Ross is drinking something and decides to get Rachel again.]\\nRoss: (to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)\\n[Time lapse, Rachel pushes the flight attendant call button, takes Ross's drink, and spills it into his lap.]\\nRoss: What the? What\\nRachel: (to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn't real, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pants would be dry.) Hi! \\nThe Flight Attendant: Miss? May I help you?\\nRachel: Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.\\n[Scene: Caesar's Palace Casino, Joey is approaching one of the blackjack tables on his quest to make enough money for his movie.]\\nJoey: (to the dealer) Can I change a hundred? (He hands him his chip.)\\nBlackjack Dealer: Changing one hundred! (Gives him the change.) Good luck sir.\\nJoey: (betting all 100) Let's ride.\\nBlackjack Dealer: (Deals the cards) 13.\\nJoey: Hit me! (He does so.) Ohh man! (Joey busts and loses all the money, but when the dealer starts to collect the cards Joey notices something.) Wait! (He holds his hand next to the dealer's hand.)\\n[Cut to Chandler's room, Joey is relaying to Chandler his amazing discovery.]\\nJoey: Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!\\nChandler: (totally confused) What?\\nJoey: My identical hand twin!\\nChandler: What's an identical hand twin?\\nJoey: What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!\\nChandler: Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?\\nJoey: Dont you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!\\nChandler: (totally confused) How?\\nJoey: Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!\\nChandler: Again I must go back to, how?\\nJoey: This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?\\nChandler: (Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.\\nJoey: Hey, are you unsupporting me again?\\nChandler: No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!\\n(Joey starts to leave to embark on his genius moneymaking scheme, but is freaked out slightly when as he goes to open the door, there's a mysterious knock. He calms himself down and opens the door to reveal Phoebe.)\\nPhoebe: Hey!\\nJoey: Pheebs!!\\nPhoebe: Yeah?\\nJoey: I found my identical hand twin!\\nPhoebe: Ohh, you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?\\nChandler: No!\\nPhoebe: But she just came up here!\\nChandler: That was Joey!\\nPhoebe: I wonder where she is. That is so weird.\\nChandler: Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.\\nPhoebe: Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!\\nChandler: Really?\\nPhoebe: Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.\\nChandler: Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)\\nPhoebe: Good. (After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checks herself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!\\n[Scene: Caesar's Palace Casino, Chandler is looking for Monica while Tom Jones's signature song is playing in the background (Getting the theme yet? Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, casinos They're in Vegas people! Catch up!) It's Not Unusual, y'know, \\\"It's not unusual to be loved by anyone! It's not unusual to have fun with anyone!  But when I see you hanging about with anyone, it's not unusual to see me cry!  I wanna die.\\\" Well, while that's playing he spots Monica playing craps and in victory hug the guy next to her. Chandler turns and walks out.]\\n[Scene: That same plane cabin, Ross is working on a crossword puzzle and Rachel is asleep against his shoulder. She shifts a little bit and Ross suddenly gets an idea. An evil idea when he looks at his pen. Then we have a little time lapse, the plane has landed and everyone is disembarking. The flight attendant is saying bye-bye to everyone.]\\nThe Flight Attendant: (to another passenger) Welcome to Las Vegas.\\n(Rachel approaches and we see the fruits of Ross's evil plan. He has drawn a moustache and beard on Rachel. The flight attendant just ignores it.)\\nThe Flight Attendant: (To Rachel) Thank you! (Not sure of herself) Enjoy your flight?\\nRachel: Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. (Disembarks)\\nThe Flight Attendant: (To Ross) Hope you had a nice flight.\\nRoss: Ohh, it was the best!\\nCommercial Break\\n[Scene: The casino, Ross and Rachel are entering.]\\nRoss: I think the check in is that way. (Points)\\nRachel: Ahh.\\n(A young boy sees Rachel, points, and starts laughing.)\\nRachel: Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally, his parents drag him off.) Ohh, kids love me.\\nPhoebe: (sees Ross and Rachel) Hey!\\nRoss: Phoebe! (They hug.) \\nPhoebe: You guys are here! Yay!\\nRachel: Hi! (Hugs Phoebe)\\nPhoebe: (sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at the slot machine Phoebe was just at.)\\nRachel: Pancho Vila?\\nPhoebe: Yeah! (Motions to her face, indicating all of Rachel's \\\"make-up.\\\")\\nRachel: What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I don't (She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God, you drew on me?!\\nRoss: Hey, you wet my pants!\\nPhoebe: Whoa, what kind of party was this?\\nRachel: Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I canyou have so crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)\\nRoss: Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. (Points in the other direction. Rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)\\n(The old lady at Phoebe's machine wins. Phoebe turns around in shock.)\\nPhoebe: Ugh!\\nRoss: What?\\nPhoebe: That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.\\nRoss: Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.\\nPhoebe: M-M-Mole people?\\nRoss: What? No-no, a lurker.\\nPhoebe: Oh. What's a lurker?\\nRoss: Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then\\nPhoebe: Kills you?\\nRoss: No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.\\nPhoebe: Ohhh!\\nRoss: Uh-hmm.\\nPhoebe: How do you know about this?\\nRoss: My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dancekarate lessons.\\nPhoebe: Dance karate?\\nRoss: Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. (Does a karate chop, then does a little dance-type sway.)\\nRachel: (returning with her purse covering her face) All right, it won't come off!\\nRoss: What?!\\nRachel: It won't come off!\\nRoss: Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?\\nRachel: No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.\\nJoey: (entering) Hey-hey-hey you made it!\\nRoss: Joey!!\\nJoey: All right! Hey-hey!\\nRachel: Hi!!\\nJoey: Who's your friend? He's hot! (Ross laughs and Rachel smacks him with her purse.)\\nRoss: (To Joey) Thanks man.\\nRachel: Hi. (She hugs Joey.)\\nRoss: Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.\\nJoey: No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!\\nRoss: Your what?\\nJoey: My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!\\nRoss: What?! That's not gonna make you any money!\\nJoey: Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.\\n[Scene: The craps table, Monica is on a big roll.]\\nMonica: All right baby, come on! (Rolls the dice) Yes! Yes! I am on fire!\\nChandler: (walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.\\nMonica: Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!\\nChandler: What does it look like? I'm going home.\\nMonica: What? Wait! Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after him.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! Im sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!\\nChandler: Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.\\nMonica: Not any more.\\nChandler: Really?!\\nMonica: Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.) Okay, this is empty.\\nChandler: Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.\\n[Scene: A blackjack table, it's the same one Joey's hand twin was working at, only he's not there anymore and has been replaced by a beautiful woman.]\\nJoey: (entering) Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?\\nThe Woman Dealer: Which guy?\\nJoey: He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (Holds up his hand.) See?\\nThe Woman Dealer: I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.\\nJoey: Okay! (Walks away, then turns back.) How you doin'?\\nThe Woman Dealer: Very busy.\\nJoey: Right! Okay. (Heads for the bathroom.)\\n[Scene: Ross and Rachel's hotel room, Rachel is still trying to get the ink off and Ross is on the phone to the company. Wait a minute, why exactly are they sharing a hotel room? Didn't they like break-up or something? Did I miss a memo? Or maybe, it's just foreshadowing things to come. Who knows? Maybe the answer's at the bottom of the page. Then again, maybe it isn't and it's just one of those things TV writers just don't explain. Anyhoo]\\nRoss: (on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you. (Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, she didn't think so. (Listens) I know it's like (turns and sees Rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Oh! Okay. (Listens) Okay, thank you! (Rachel gets excited at his tone.) (Hangs up the phone) Yeah, it's not coming off.\\nRachel: What?! What else did he say?\\nRoss: Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So(Rachel stares at him.) Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.\\nRachel: Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!\\nRoss: Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.\\nRachel: Ross, I am a human doodle!!\\nRoss: Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around and glares at him.) There are tonsoffreaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!\\n(They both exit.)\\n[Time lapse, they're both entering.]\\nRoss: Okay, there was some staring and pointing.\\nRachel: Okay, I need a, I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)\\nRoss: Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel glares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is, one big drink! \\nRachel: (she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.) Macadamia nut?\\nRoss: (looking at the price list) Umm Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!\\nRachel: Hm-mmm! (Opens the container)\\nRoss: Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?\\nRachel: Nope! (She puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in another direction.)\\n[Scene: The casino, Phoebe is playing on a slot machine. Suddenly the lurker sticks her head around the aisle of slot machines.]\\nPhoebe: (seeing her) Get out of here you lurker! (She doesn't move) Go on! Get!

You made up!\\nMonica: Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.\\nChandler: Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)\\nPhoebe: Ohh, get a room.\\nMonica: We have one.\\nPhoebe: I know. Use it.\\n[Scene: The Men's room, Joey is entering and sees his hand twin washing his hands.]\\nJoey: Oh-oh-oh, yeah! (He grabs some towels and takes them to him.)

It's your call.\\n(Pause.)\\nChandler: It's a four.\\nMonica: I think so too.\\n(Cue up the music as they move in and kiss. This time I think it's Perry Como, but I'm not sure. It's Everybody loves somebody, sometime! Everybody falls in love somehow! Something in your kiss, just told me, my sometime, is now!)\\n[Scene: The slot machines, Phoebe is still feeding quarters into the one-armed bandit as the lurker peeks over the top of the machines.]\\nPhoebe: Oh well, lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker scurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her in the act.) That's it! You and me, outside!\\nThe Lurker: I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!\\n(They start smacking each other's cups, but Phoebe notices a security guard approaching.)\\nPhoebe: Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady, your lurking days are over!\\nThe Lurker: What?!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?\\nThe Lurker: Also Monday.\\nPhoebe: What time? Maybe we can share a cab!\\n[Scene: Ross and Rachel's room, they've pretty much consumed the entire mini-bar.

Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. (He starts to sit down on the bed. There's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it. Needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?\\nJoey: Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! (He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.) Hey Rach, how you doin'?\\nRachel: I'm doin' good, baby.

There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.\\n[Cut to the casino, a very drunk and doodled on Rachel is walking arm in arm with an equally drunk and doodled on Ross are walking through the casino and greeting people on their way through. Ross has some whiskers and his nose colored in, along with his name on his forehead.] \\nRoss: Well hello! I'm Ross!\\nRachel: Good luck to ya!\\nRoss: Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here. (He points to the corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)\\n(They've made their way to the statue of the naked man that Chandler was leaning against earlier.)\\nRachel: Wow!\\nRoss: (bowing) Hello!\\nRachel: (bowing) Hello!\\nRoss and Rachel: (bowing) Hello!\\n(They both continue on and Ross meows like a cat.)\\n[Scene: The slot machines, we see some guy not having any luck. Both Phoebe and the Lurker are lurking him and each stick their heads around the corner at different times This is all set to that Pink Panther song. Finally the guy gives up and walks past the lurker's position, thus giving her the advantage. She scurries in and quickly drops a coin in the slot before Phoebe gets there. Phoebe arrives slightly later and pulls the arm just after the lurker deposits the coin and wins.]\\nPhoebe: I won! I won! I finally won!\\nThe Lurker: I won! That was my quarter!\\nPhoebe: Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! (Gives back her quarter.)\\n(The security guard approaches.)\\nThe Lurker: (to the guard) Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money.

Not yet, anyway (Shakes his hands.)\\nJoey's Hand Twin: You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.\\nJoey: (throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold it, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, looking at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho! (The dealer stares at him and he stops.)\\nPhoebe: (entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looks down) Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.\\nJoey's Hand Twin: (To Joey) 14.\\nJoey: Hit me! (He does so.)\\nPhoebe: Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.\\nJoey's Hand Twin: Stop it!\\nJoey: Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?\\nJoey's Hand Twin: Please stop it!\\nJoey: Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?\\nJoey's Hand Twin: (To Joey) If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!\\n(The security guard from before approaches and Phoebe tries to turn her back on him.) \\nThe Security Guard: (To Phoebe) Didn't I just throw you out of here?\\nPhoebe: No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!\\nThe Security Guard: Come on, lady! (Starts to escort her out.)\\nJoey's Hand Twin: Please, please take him too. (Motions to Joey.)\\nJoey: Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! (Being dragged out by the guard) I'm your hand twin!!\\n[Scene: A Little White Chapel, Chandler and Monica are entering.]\\nChandler: Hello! One marriage please!\\nMonica: Yep, we wanna get married! \\nThe Attendant: Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.\\nChandler and Monica: All right.\\n(They both sit down.)\\nChandler: (singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!\\nMonica: What are you doing?\\nChandler: Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?\\nMonica: No, only because that's the graduation song.\\n(The real Wedding March begins playing from behind the closed doors of the chapel.)\\nChandler: Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!\\nMonica: Are you sure you wanna do this?\\n(Suddenly the doors burst open, and ROSS AND RACHEL COME OUT ARM-IN-ARM!!!!!

(Throws some more rice.)\\n(They storm out into the street.)\\nRachel: Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!\\n(She goes one way; he goes the other. The camera pans back to Chandler and Monica, and needless to say, they're standing there dumbstruck as The King's (Elvis Presley to the yougin's) Viva, Las Vegas begins to play.

She'd like to say thanks again for letting us stay here whilst she looks around, and now if you could just point us in the direction of our room...\n","Monica (still angry): And so long as they don't take off all their clothing before bedtime......I wish my brother hadn't slept with his best friend's wife. But then why didn't you stop them? Why did you make dinner when things were cooling down, or come upstairs instead of sitting down there? Just once I want everything to happen exactly as planned. Everything has gone wrong today; people getting married, the wedding dress not fitting, your job being threatened..... I had big plans for tonight. You weren't supposed to be home till tomorrow afternoon...... And don't look so happy about coming back early either. Now I feel really embarrassed because it took two phone calls to find one available seat - and it costs extra money to change flights - and you gotta do it through me 'cause only I have the credit card right.... Well I bet your flight went cheap...didn't need to book ahead because no-one else wants to go where you are going any more........What's got into you?

Look guys we need another miracle alright this time without the singing so what kind of lucky thing happened to you since you last saw each other well Phoebe has lost twenty pounds and gained the ability to see ghosts but I'm pretty sure neither will help us find this ring ....So while i wait for the psychic lady to turn up ...... I guess we should probably use the restrooms ...I mean, I dunno, I hope they aren't trashed cause remember I have this meeting first thing Monday morning .....and also, there might be a guy here who needs to ask \"the question\" , you know, ummm... Will you marry me ?......\n","Chandler: Are these kids okay? Chander, i heard you went to college, I even talked to your old teacher, turns out both your parents were hippies. That's wild. And they've been living off the land ever since. What do they eat? Is meat allowed? Maybe we ought to send 'em over a few hamburgers. No thanks, actually those burgers we brought were way better than anything I grew up eating. Did anybody call the cops yet? The police already called twice, they wanna talk to everyone but nobody's talking anymore\n","Father: So your son says you used to work here, oh that must've been quite sometime ago. Monica: Uh huh, and when he said they needed someone quick, I volunteered immediately. Dad: Good girl, very good yes that'll be five dollars thank you. Monica: Mum gave me that tenner just in case I ran out of spending money while I worked in London. Dad: Did she now? Oh very clever mother, now listen, whatever happens, it stays between us okay. Don't worry, nothing nasty happened here Monica. At least, nothing we haven't heard about before. So you met the owner outside, and then what? The woman was standing by the entrance shouting abuse across three lanes of traffic. Okay let's start fresh shall we. What brings you home mummy? Oh you always told me I shouldn't lie about these sort of things. Alright fine! Because I am lying!
